How to contribute to Trackbook
==============================

### Report a bug or suggest a new feature
Bugs and new features are being discussed on the GitHub [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/y20k/trackbook/issues). 

### Help with translations
Trackbook is not available in different languages (yet). I plan to get an account for Trackbook on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/). In the meantime... If you want to help out, please contact me and check out [strings.xml](https://github.com/y20k/trackbook/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml). 

### Submit your own solutions
Help is very welcome. Be it in the form of code, or artwork, or enhancements to the website, or tutorial videos, or whatever. 
**But please** suggest new features or enhancements in advance on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/y20k/trackbook/issues) before implementing them.
